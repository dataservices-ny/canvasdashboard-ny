          comment: 'Hi Jose,\nIt looks like you did a nice amount of investigation and collected great data.  However your notes are not quite at the point where I want to grade them (you wouldn\'t like the grade).  Please carefully review the requirements on the investigation guide.  You need:\n- more detailed notes on your methods\n- a data table\n- a formal analysis paragraph (claim, evidence, reasoning)',

For your explantation: what happens to the diaphragm of the microphone? I think you can do a little better on your model. The draft if fine but try to neaten it up for the final draft.',
