The goal for students is to construct logically coherent explanations of phenomena that incorporate their current understanding of science, or a model that represents it, and are consistent with the available evidence.<br><br/>Explanations that meet 9th grade expectations:<br><br/> - Use written explanations to connect phenomena, observations, and measurements to a model or theory that represents an accurate understanding of the science concepts under investigation.<br><br/> - Clarity may be affected by lack of coherence or minor misunderstandings of the science concepts.<br><br/>Explanations that exceed 9th grade expectations:<br><br/> - Are logically coherent and uses clear reasoning to connect evidence (observations and measurements) to a model or theory that represents an accurate understanding of the science concepts.<br>',
