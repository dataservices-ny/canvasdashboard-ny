My name is [enter name]. I was your student in elementary school and am now a ninth grader at Avenues: The World School, in Chelsea. Our grade is working on a project that involves testing to see if New York City’s tap water is as clean and safe to drink as it is claimed to be. We have been studying the effects of contaminated water and how to test the safety of drinking water. Our plan is to collect 1000 water samples from around New York City. This will allow us to gather diverse samples and share our results with our NYC community. </p>\r\n<p>We aim to collect tap water samples from public elementary school students in all 5 boroughs of NYC. We plan on sending schools containers for 5th grade students to collect water samples from their homes. Then, students from our grade will come to the schools to collect samples and teach students how we measure water quality and what makes water safe to drink. </p>\r\n<p>If you are interested in working with us or have any follow up questions feel free to contact me and/or the teachers who have been CC’d on this email. We hope to hear from you soon!</p>\r\n<p>Thank you,</p>\r\n<p>(your name) </p>',

A basic practice of the scientist is formulating empirically answerable questions about phenomena.<br>\nTo meet 9th grade expectations students, verbally and in their notes:<br>\n - Generate and develop testable questions based on observed phenomena to determine relationships, including quantitative relationships, between independent and dependent variables.<br>\n - Ask clarifying questions to build knowledge and understanding of concepts.<br>\nTo exceed 9th grade expectations students, verbally and in their notes:<br>\n - Ask high-level conceptual questions that get to the core of a scientific concept.<br>\n - Ask questions that generate ideas for further scientific investigation.<br>\n - Ask critical questions while conducting investigations that lead to a more nuanced understanding of the data and conclusions.',

The goal for students is to construct logically coherent explanations of phenomena that incorporate their current understanding of science, or a model that represents it, and are consistent with the available evidence.<br>\nExplanations that meet 9th grade expectations:<br>\n - Use written explanations to connect phenomena, observations, and measurements to a model or theory that represents an accurate understanding of the science concepts under investigation.<br>\n - Clarity may be affected by lack of coherence or minor misunderstandings of the science concepts.<br>\nExplanations that exceed 9th grade expectations:<br>\n - Are logically coherent and uses clear reasoning to connect evidence (observations and measurements) to a model or theory that represents an accurate understanding of the science concepts.<br>',

Can we find 20 or 30 minutes to sit down so we can talk about it and look through my notebook. I have a worksheet Mr. Carpenter has asked us to fill out together that is due next Monday.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Your eternally loving and grateful child,</p>\r\n<p>[[your name]]</p>',

Briefly explain how an individual avidian can acquire the ability to perform the NOT function.</strong></p>\r\n<p>After many random mutations, an individual organism can have the right combinations of mutations on its genome (DNA) to perform the not function. This can happen whether or not the NOTOSE resource is turned on since the process is random.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. In Experiment 2, as time passed, why did more and more organisms have the ability to perform the NOT function?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The organisms with the NOT function could use the NOTOSE to reproduce more quickly, as shown by their higher fitness, so they added more and more offspring to the dish.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. When placed in a dish with no resources in Experiment 1, both of your organisms have roughly equal fitness. What is fitness and why are the two organisms\' fitnesses equal?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Fitness is an organism\'s ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. Since there is no NOTOSE the organism that can perform the NOT function isn\'t any faster at getting energy or better at reproducing that the other organism, so their fitness is the same.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. When placed in a dish with the NOTOSE resource, the organism that could perform the NOT function has a higher fitness than the other organism. Why is this?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Fitness is an organism\'s ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. Since there is NOTOSE in the dish the organism that can perform the NOT function is faster at getting energy and better reproducing that the other organism, so its fitness is higher.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5.

Scientific explanations are explicit applications of theory to a specific situation or phenomenon. The goal for students is to construct logically coherent explanations of phenomena that incorporate their current understanding of science, or a model that represents it, and are consistent with the available evidence.<br>\nExplanations that meet 9th grade expectations:<br>\n - Use written explanations to connect phenomena, observations, and measurements to a model or theory that represents an accurate understanding of the science concepts under investigation.<br>\n - Clarity may be affected by lack of coherence or minor misunderstandings of the science concepts.<br>\nExplanations that exceed 9th grade expectations:<br>\n - Are logically coherent and uses clear reasoning to connect evidence (observations and measurements) to a model or theory that represents an accurate understanding of the science concepts.<br>',
